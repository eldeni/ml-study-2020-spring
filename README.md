# Study - Convolutional Neural Network

## Motivation
Convolutional Neural Network, or CNN, has become one of the most visited topics of research for years. It is commonly used in analyzing visual information. Understanding the mechanics of this type of artificial neural networks is crucial in grasping the underlying principle of modern day deep learning based machine intelligence approaches.

## Prerequisites
**Anyone, regardless of their academic backgrounds or whatsoever** can join this study session as long as they want to learn. With that said, many of the discussions may touch upon the concepts from computer science and statistics. This includes logistic/linear regressions, basic data structure, matrix operations, derivatives, and so on. Again, the initiative is to self teach ourselves, and we will aim to do our best to bring members on our study group on the same page.

> Just bring your will, curiosity, and a little bit of preparation.
